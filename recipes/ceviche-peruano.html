    <h4>
      Ceviche is a South American seafood dish originally from what is the
      modern day country of Peru.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Typically made from fresh raw fish cured in fresh citrus juices, most
      commonly lemon or lime, it is also spiced with aj√≠, chili peppers or other
      seasonings and julienned red onions, salt, and coriander are also added.
      The name originates from the Quechuan word siwichi, which means fresh or
      tender fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the dish is eaten raw, and not cooked with heat, it must be
      prepared fresh and consumed immediately to minimize the risk of food
      poisoning. Ceviche is often eaten as an appetizer; if eaten as a main
      dish, it is usually accompanied by side dishes that complement its
      flavors, such as sweet potato, lettuce, maize, avocado, or cooking banana.

      <li>2 potatoes</li>
      <li>2 sweet potatoes</li>
      <li>1 red onion, cut into thin strips</li>
      <li>1 cup fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>1/2 stalk celery, sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 cup lightly packed cilantro leaves</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 habanero pepper, seeded and minced</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 pound fresh tilapia, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 pound medium shrimp, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 bibb or Boston lettuce, separated into leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the potatoes and sweet potatoes in a saucepan and cover with
        water. Simmer until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, then
        drain, and set aside to cool to room temperature. Place the sliced onion
        in a bowl of warm water, let stand 10 minutes, then drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, place the lime juice, celery, cilantro, and cumin into the
        bowl of a blender, and puree until smooth. Pour this mixture into a
        large glass bowl, and stir in the garlic and habanero pepper. Season
        with salt and pepper, then stir in the diced tilapia and shrimp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set aside to marinate for an hour, stirring occasionally. The seafood is
        done once it turns firm and opaque.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, peel the potatoes and cut into slices. Stir the onions into
        the fish mixture. Line serving bowls with lettuce leaves. Spoon the
        ceviche with its juice into the bowls and garnish with slices of potato.
