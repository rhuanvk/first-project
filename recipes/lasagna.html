    <h4>
      Pesto lasagna is a special recipe in which two stars of our cuisine come
      together harmoniously in a first course of homemade pasta that evokes the
      flavors of tradition.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Layers of handmade egg pasta sheets alternate with a tasty and strong
      Genoese pesto (basil sauce) to be prepared with the first leaves of basil
      offered by the season. The béchamel sauce, which gives a velvety touch and
      makes the sheets creamy, is a must in this dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      While a bit time consuming, pesto lasagna is a multiple-step process of
      homemade preparations that will repay you in terms of taste and the
      rewarding feeling of having done everything yourself.
