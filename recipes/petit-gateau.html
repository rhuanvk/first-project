    <h4>
      A petit gateau (French for “little cake”) is, as its name implies, a small
      cake. Petit gateaus traditionally feature an assortment of hidden
      textures, most often a rich, creamy filling that spills forth from the
      crunchy rind when cut open.
    </h4>
    <p>
      It's hard to pinpoint when French pastry chefs first started to make
      little cakes. One of the best-known versions of the petit gateau is the
      “molten” chocolate cake, invented by chef Michel Bras in 1981. The dessert
      gained wide popularity throughout New York City, and in the 1990s, mostly
      thanks to fellow celebrity chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten.

      Before long, the chocolate petit gateau had become a classic flourish at
      the end of an upscale meal, served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and
      mint sprig. Since its inception, the petit gateau has evolved beyond a
      melted chocolate center to include flavors like caramel, peanut butter,
      liqueur, and tropical fruit.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>12 ounces bittersweet chocolate, melted and cooled</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
      <li>4 large eggs plus 2 egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Dutch-process cocoa powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons espresso powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, to serve</li>
      <li>Fresh mint, for garnish</li>
      <li>Flaky sea salt, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and lightly grease the wells
        of a cupcake tin.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, combine the melted chocolate, melted butter,
        eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla extract and whisk together until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, cocoa
        powder, espresso powder, and salt and whisk to incorporate evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the dry ingredients into the
        chocolate mixture until the batter is smooth with no streaks of flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the batter evenly between the 12 wells of the greased cupcake
        tin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the petits gateau until the outer edges of each cake are set and
        crisp, and the center registers an internal temperature of 165 degrees
        Fahrenheit but is still wet, 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the cakes from the oven and cool slightly in the cupcake tin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run an offset spatula or butter knife around the edges of each cake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a clean cutting board over the pan, quickly invert, and slowly
        remove the cupcake tin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer each cake to a plate and serve with a scoop of vanilla ice
        cream, topped with a sprig of mint and a pinch of flaky sea salt.
      </li>
    </ol>
